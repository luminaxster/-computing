# From classes to Docs

We now do a traversal of every week to culminate in the Java docs, the official one.

## The directories

The root directory for the example is `week06`, wich contains the directories `day22` and and `day23`.

## The Java files

There are 4 Java files: `C.java` in `day23/` and `A.java`, `B.java`, and `C.java` in `day22/`
